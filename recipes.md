## Recipes

### Whey Pancake

<div class="fitness-info__prep">
  <div class="fitness-info__prep-container">
    <p>The flavor of whey (obtained by draining yogurt in a fine sieve) is similar to that of buttermilk, though the liquid itself is much thinner. Whey's natural acidity reacts perfectly with baking soda to produce wonderful leavening (carbon dioxide bubbles) in these pancakes. </p>
    <p>Not only will they be light and fluffy, any leftovers will stay soft and fresh thanks to that same acidity.

      Blend the liquid ingredients with the dry taking about 20 seconds. (Don't overdo it. Pancake batter is like muffin batter; a light hand in mixing means a light pancake on the plate.)

      Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat, or set an electric griddle to 375Â°F. Lightly grease frying pan or griddle. The pan or griddle is ready if a drop of water will skitter across the surface, evaporating immediately.
